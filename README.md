I was a recent RS intern at Google DeepMind, and I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge advised by Mihaela van der Schaar in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence group. To date, I have published twelve papers as first or joint first author in top-tier ML conferences (NeurIPS [spotlight], ICML [long oral], ICLR [spotlight], RSS and AISTATS).

I thrive driving foundational research to advance the state-of-the-art for LLM output generation, including LLM agents using external memory and tool use. My recent work solved key problems to enable LLM agents for generating coherent outputs at scale, beyond context limits through updating external memory and multi-agent generation evolutionary frameworks. I would love to be part of a team to invent and drive new prototypes forwards by adapting flexibly to deliver project success in the areas of multi-modal LLM agents, and using RL to improve LLM agents automatically. Here on GitHub you can find research projects as well as open source software developed in my spare time.
