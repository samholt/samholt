I'm a PhD student in the [van der Schaar lab](), a world-leading machine learning (ML) research group at the [University of Cambridge]().
My research focuses on deep machine learning methods for continuous-time control; this encompasses new forms of model-based reinforcement learning. 
Here on GitHub you can find research projects as well as open source software developed in my spare time.

Support my open source projects by sponsoring: ![GitHub Sponsors](https://img.shields.io/github/sponsors/samholt)
